## Issues
* I originally emailed you about an issue selecting the individual
box to change the background color. While I did figure that issue out,
I ended up going in a completely different direction.

* I had an issue getting the second set of numbers to show.
Of course it ended up being a typo issue!

* I had another issue where I was trying to get element by id and
I had it added as a class instead of an id. Another simple fix.

* My last issue was with formatting my fortune. I wanted to use a
background, but it wasn't taking up the entire screen. I ended up
creating a class on the wrapper to hold my background image.
